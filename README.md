# Factors-Affecting-Likelihood-of-Undergoing-Bariatric-Surgery

This repository contains codes used for the paper: "Factors contributing to whether or not people with obesity undergo bariatric surgery". It provides an in-depth exploration and modeling on how various factors could potentially integrate and affect the likelihood of people undergoing bariatric surgery. The primary goal is to help people better know in which circumstance whether or not they should choose to do a bariatric surgery.

The codebook contains codes to use LASSO variable selection to find effective and helpful variables as there are a lot of initial independent variables, and bootstrap to find the confidence interval of coefficients of each included variables. Then, a logistic regression is being formed to predict the likelihood.
